        On November 6, 1869, Rutgers and Princeton played what was billed as the first college football game. 
        <br>However, it wasn't until the 1880s that a great rugby player from Yale, Walter Camp, pioneered rules changes that slowly transformed rugby into the new game of American Football.

    <p class="historyNotes">
        Football, also called association football or soccer, game in which two teams of 11 players, 
        <br>using any part of their bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal.
        <br>Only the goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. 
        <br>The team that scores more goals wins

        Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had been played in towns 
        <br>and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. 
        <br>Industrialization and urbanization, which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, 
        <br>combined with a history of legal prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine the game’s status from the early 19th century onward.
        <br>However, football was taken up as a winter game between residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton. 
        <br>Each school had its own rules; some allowed limited handling of the ball and others did not. 
        <br>The variance in rules made it difficult for public schoolboys entering university to continue playing except with former schoolmates. 
        <br>As early as 1843 an attempt to standardize and codify the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge, 
        <br>whose students joined most public schools in 1848 in adopting these “Cambridge rules,” which were further spread by Cambridge graduates who formed football clubs. 
        <br>In 1863 a series of meetings involving clubs from metropolitan London and surrounding counties produced the printed rules of football, which prohibited the carrying of the ball. 
        <br>Thus, the “handling” game of rugby remained outside the newly formed Football Association (FA). 
        <br>Indeed, by 1870 all handling of the ball except by the goalkeeper was prohibited by the FA.
